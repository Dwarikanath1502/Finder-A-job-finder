                    The philosophy is that you can never have too many filters
                    for any intelligent web portal, however if you are creating
                    a website for a job board, a selection for a smart filter
                    are a must so your users can use your job portal in a
                    stagnation. Job seekers expect desired and immediate results
                    from a job portal. This job portal website feature provides
                    the seeker with perfect match from the flock of job listing,
                    and filters for which he has to apply and get rid of
                    navigating every job post and find the ones that fit his
                    requirement. With the execution of each agile filter, his
                    time for job search will reduce significantly with burning
                    efforts.
