                    one of those two groups â€“ and mostly paid subscription model
                    for employers and job listing companies. This revenue model
                    generates revenue by charging the employers a recurring fee
                    based on either tenure-based subscription or limit with
                    number of job posting on purchased package.While on the
                    other side, not every job seeker wants to spend money on
